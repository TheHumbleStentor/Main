<p><h1>ANTHONY'S VERY FIRST WEBSITE (Of Great Wonder!)</h1></p>

<p>Greetings, intrepid visitor!</p>
<p>My name is Anthony, and I welcome you to this, my very first webpage using HTML coding!</p>

<p>I do hope you'll enjoy the simple demonstrations of various beginning coding skills I have learned.</p>
</center>

<p>For example...</p>
Did you know I can make text <b>bold</b>?<br>
How about text in <i>italics</i>?<br>
And no, of course we shouldn't forget text that is <u>underlined</u>!<br>
<p>(And hopefully you noticed how certain elements of the page are centered while others are not. Astounding, right?)</p>
<p align="right">Truly...will wonders never cease?</p align="right">

<center>
Now then. Let's ramp things up a bit.<br><br><br>

What's that you say? You want a link to an outside webpage?<br>
<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-Ask-And-You-Shall-Receive/"target="_blank">Ask, and ye shall receive!</a><br><br>
I know what you're thinking:<h3>"HOLY CRAPPOLI, <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-stromboli/"target="_blank">STROMBOLI!</a> This guy is a wizard!"</h3>
Truth be told, nah, I'm just like you: I put my pants on one leg at a time.<br>
(Except when *I'm* done, I make HTML webpages full of teenage humor.)<br><br><br>

</center>

Okay, what's next in the webpage agenda?<br>
You're absolutely right. It's never not a good time for a meme (or two).<br><br>

<img src="meme.png"><img width="500" height="800" src="meme.png">..........Perspective is everything, eh?<br><br><br><br><br>

<center>
For our next course, we have a vintage youtube clip embedded into the webpage:<br><br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIR3pCgqb5o?si=MTVYObec0ZxGxK0E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
Poignant, I know. Something, something, "method to my madness," something, something.<br><br><br></center>

So, at this point, you're probably thinking to yourself,<br>
"I have got to meet this guy.<br>
He's talented...<br>
Funny...<br>
And he *obviously* has a lot of spare time on his hands."<br>

<center>(Okay, um, <i>rude</i>, but you'll get few arguments from me.)</center><br><br>

So here's what I'll do.<br>
I know there are common-sense rules about giving internet strangers your information.<br>
But I'll put those aside and tell you where I live.<br><br>

But you have to <b>promise</b> you won't judge me, okay?
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Keep scrolling...

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Just a bit farter...

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

You ready?

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<i>Promise you won't laugh?</i>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
